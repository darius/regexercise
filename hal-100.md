== The HAL 100

This is a toy computer designed to make its running easy to follow,
with 100 words of main memory, 9 general-purpose registers, and 10
instructions. Here's a short example program in assembly language:

    ;; Comments start with semicolons.
            set     r9,,1           ;   r9 = 1;
    loop    getch   r1              ; loop: r1 = getchar();
            ifeq    r1,'X',done     ;   if (r1 != 'X') goto done;
            add     r9,,1           ;   r9 += 1;
            jump    ,,loop          ;   goto loop;
    done    found                   ; done: exit(0);

The comments on the right give an almost-equivalent C program.


Each word is a 9-character string, like

    fetch1020

== The instructions

=== fetch

=== store

=== set

=== add

=== jump

=== ifeq

=== ifne

=== getch

=== found

=== noop
